    <h1>Dorian</h1>
    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...And everyone was ready leave ....Hurricane Dorian was on his way...</p>
    <p>What? <strong>Dorian</strong> is no joke. "Go away," the people said. <br>"We don't want to board up our houses and lose power on a 
    long weekend!"</p>
    <strong>THE END.</strong>
